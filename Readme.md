**What's new & what does it need**

I add a BluetoothKeyboard to this library and it is based on HX-03-HID module. It can easily send keyboard actions to the computer, iPad and mobile phone. Please connect the arduino and HX-03-HID according to the example program and upload it to the Arduino. Then it will send characters to the computer frequently.
